# elevator-simulator
Software to simulate an elevator system, mostly used for Object-Oriented Programming Practice.

# Background
I originally was assigned this problem as part of an interview, and I thought it was a fun design challenge.

The original problem was basically to code a system that efficiently managed four elevators in a tall office building. Each floor had a control panel that would allow you to specify which floor you were trying to reach.

# Assumptions
I assume:

*The number of elevators can vary.
*Each elevator can hold ten passengers, regardless of weight.
*Each elevator moves at the same speed.
*It takes just as much energy to move an elevator up as it does to move it down.
*We want to minimize both energy spent and time it takes for a person to arrive at their destination.
